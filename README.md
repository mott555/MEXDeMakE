Mott's Enterprise XML Decision-Making Engine

Mott's Enterprise XML Decision-Making Engine (MEXDeMakE) uses a world-class XML configuration format
to make it easily configurable. You can easily modify available decisions, work factor,
and the increment value.

In all seriousness, this is an entry to TDWTF's OMGWTF2 programming contest

Do not use this for anything, ever. And please don't judge me. This is intentionally bad code.
